Roxxor Editor
============

### JSON/XML editor that roxx as a unicorn.

Roxxor editor uses PyQt4 for its GUI, so obviously PyQt4 is a dependency of roxxor.

To test the roxxor JSON editor:

~~~
    cd roxxoreditor
    ./roxxor.py
~~~

*! The XML editor is not functional yet !*

More features will be added soon, keep an eye on it!

### Our goals:

* A total support for JSON editing/creating
* A total support for XML editing/creating
* The user must not have to edit the JSON/XML directly
* Having a module architecture to have the possibility to add easily other SGML
* Having a ergonomic, nice looking and easy to use UI
